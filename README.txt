This software queries the free cash flows and strike values from the user 
to obtain the project value within the Real Option Model, based on Geske and
a binomial tree approach.

As a second step in the Real Option Model, it calculates the option values
from the binomial tree of possible project values for the underlying investment
opportunity, based on a rollback calculation.

The userform and main calculations are separated code.
